				<h1>SHS IN SAN NICHOLAS III, BACOOR CITY</h1>
				<!-- Page Description -->
				<p>Aiming to enhance the basic education system in the Philippines, the Department of Education complied with the implementation of the K-12 program, as mandated by Republic Act 10533 or the “Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013”. This law added two years to basic education and also strengthened the curriculum. Now, twelve years of basic education is required from all public schools around the country. Like other Division offices, the City Schools Division of Bacoor implemented the K-12 program. This implementation in 2016 manifested in the creation of five stand alone Senior High Schools in Bacoor: in Alima, Progressive, Dulong Bayan, Sineguelasan, and the biggest in the city, in San Nicholas III.
 
The Senior High School in San Nicholas was established and opened last June 3, 2016. The School operated temporarily in the buildings of City of Bacoor National High School Green Valley. Now, it has its own operating location, and is in the process of improving on its facilities.
 
In its first three years of operation, Senior High School in San Nicholas, Bacoor City so far has been headed by four outstanding heads: Mr. Avelino S. Legaspi, Mr. Ronald R. Drio, Dr. Cesar M. Mojica, and the present school head, Mr. Adorando R. Darvin, Principal II.
 
With only 19 teaching personnel and 320 students in its inception, the biggest senior high school in Bacoor has been seeing an increase in the number of its teaching and non-teaching staff, and its student population.
 
Senior High School in San Nicholas, Bacoor City offers the following tracks: the Academic Track, and the Technical- Vocational-Livelihood Track. The Academic Track has two strands: the Humanities and Social Sciences strand, which aims to mold learners’ communication skills, knowledge of fundamental human and social realities, and values, and the General Academic Strand, which provides opportunities for a wide range of career choices in the future. The second Track, the Technical Vocational Livelihood Track, has two strands: the Information and Communications Technology Strand, which provides timely knowledge and skills related to the demands of the digital age, and the Home Economics Strand, which allows for the development of learners’ innate abilities related to food and beverage.
 
In order to fulfill the schools’ mission of preparing its students to find decent jobs and establish successful businesses, the faculty and staff have dedicated significant time and effort for the enhancement of the students’ capabilities to realize their full potential.

It is where quality learning and diversity of opportunities are realities…every student will have their future here, in Senior High School in San Nicholas, Bacoor City.
